## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev # -- --open (to open the app in a new browser tab)
npm run test
npm run format
npm run check
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
